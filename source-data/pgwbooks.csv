,The Man with Two Left Feet,1917,Primary,Stories,,"A collection of thirteen short stories, one of which, ""Extricating Young Gussie"", introduces Jeeves, Bertie, and Aunt Agatha, though Bertie's surname may be Mannering-Phipps rather than Wooster. Bertie has a cousin named Gussie Mannering-Phipps. Bertram did not have a surname, and it remains a matter of considerable debate amongst Wodehouse scholars as to whether he was indeed Bertie Wooster, or merely Bertie Mannering-Phipps.",
